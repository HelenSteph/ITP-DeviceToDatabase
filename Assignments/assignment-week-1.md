## Hardware 

For the February 4th class bring:
 * Arduino MKR1000 or MKR WiFi 1010
 * Solderless breadboard
 * Jumper wires
 * DHT-22 or DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor
 * USB cable
 * Laptop

If you don't have a DHT-22 or DHT-11, you can other sensors like SHT31-D, BME280, Si7021, etc. You will need to modify the example code to work with your sensor. I'll bring a few extra sensors that people can borrow during class.

I recommend that you borrow an Arduino MKR1000 board from the ER. If you email Rob Ryan, you should be able keep the hardware for the duration of the class.
