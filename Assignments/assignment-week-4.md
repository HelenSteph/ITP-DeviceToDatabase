# Assignment - Week 4

## Assignment: Read

 * [Why SQL is beating NoSQL, and what this means for the future of data](https://blog.timescale.com/why-sql-beating-nosql-what-this-means-for-future-of-data-time-series-database-348b777b847a/)
 * [InfluxDB Key Concepts](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/key_concepts/)

## Assignment: Hardware

Refine your Plant Sensor Arduino code from the [last assignment](assignment-week-3.md) based on my feedback you receive via email. Keep your sensor running so it's continuously sending data. We want to gather a few weeks of real data.

## Assignment: SQL

1) Practice writing SQL queries against the `itp` and `farm` databases.

2) Use the `farm` database. Write queries to answer the following questions:

   a. When did the outside sensor break and stop sending data? <br/>
   b. Show the min and max temperature in the root cellar by year <br/>
   c. What was the lowest temperature recorded 2018? <br/>

  Challenge: Which sensor recorded the lowest temperature 2018 and when? Hint: you need a subquery.

3) Write two queries that use data from your sensor.

  Optional: write a blog post about the queries and results for your sensor data
