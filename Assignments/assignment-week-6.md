# Assignment - Week 6

## Grafana

Use Grafana to create a dashboard. Use data from InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. Include an explanation of what you built along with screenshots of the graph and the query used to build it. 

## Node-RED

Create a flow using Node-RED. Describe what the flow does. Submit a screenshot of flow and other information showing how it works. Submit an [exported version of the flow](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export) via email. If you use any Node-RED plugins, be sure to not that so I can duplicate your workflow.

## AWS

Set up an AWS ~~student or~~ free [developer](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account to use in the next class. You might need a credit card to sign up, but we'll be using the free tier so you shouldn't accrue any charges.

NOTE: Unfortunately the AWS Educate account will not work.

## Arduino

Bring an Arduino 1000 or 1010 to class. It should be wired like the exercises from [week 2](https://github.com/don/ITP-DeviceToDatabase/blob/master/02_Arduino_MQTT/exercises/exercise2.md) with a temperature & humidity sensor  and an LED. We'll use a modified version of the [AWS.ino](https://github.com/don/ITP-DeviceToDatabase/blob/master/02_Arduino_MQTT/arduino/AWS/AWS.ino) sketch to send data to *your* AWS server. 

Note: If you use your existing hardware you don't need to remove the extra components. We just need to load new code onto the boards.
 
## Due Dates

The AWS and Arduino portions must be completed before class on March 29th.

The Grafana and Node-RED portions are due on April 1st.
